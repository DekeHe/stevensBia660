dont let the price fool you,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021","What a gem. I was simply blown away with the quality of this product. It is very well made, crisp highs and deep bass. Large ear coverings, and gentle fit for long wearing. Comfortable while lying in bed. Easiest connection ever. From unboxing to working less than 5 mins. This replaces a $200 sony and now I feel nuts for spending all that money on the sony",5
Easy to set up!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2021","I'm not a techie, but I had no difficulty setting it up. I use this to watch/listen to some cable stations. Previous headphones stop working after many years of use. I expect the same with these headphones.",5
As advertised,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021",I can tun the tv sound off & enjoy my program while others in the room visit or play - works great when kids are playing.,5
Great headphones for the money,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021",These headphones are light weight and comfortable. They paired up easily with our new Samsung 9000 series TV. Be sure to turn on your Bluetooth access on the Samsung TV and it will pop right up.,5
"Makes spoken words clearer for me, not the best for music","Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2021","I have profound hearing loss in the ranges of most spoken human voices, among others. These headphones add bass to the sound stream which helps me understand TV dialogue much better than the previous headphones I used. They're not the greatest for music, but my previous headphones were digital optical, and these are RCA analogue. Not a deal breaker for my crappy ears, but somebody wanting true sound fidelity might be disappointed. Hey, rock and roll is supposed to be loud and scratchy, right?",5
Changed my life,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2022","My sweetheart is very hard of hearing and it was impossible to watch anything that had a character with an accent. (He has good hearing aides). I bought these so we could watch comedians and numerous other movies and TV shows and they have been excellent. He hears everything, doesn't misunderstand the jokes, etc. Better yet, he prefers to read down in the evenings and I have shows he doesn't like to watch. Then I put on the earphones, watch what I want and it doesn't disturb his reading. Very easy to use, just hold button down for five seconds, they turn on and we are off to a pleasant evening.",5
Worth the money,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021","I have had these wireless headphones for quite some time. I ordered these for my husband. He thinks they are great - comfortable and sound is sharp.
Would definitely recommend",5
You get more then what you pay for!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2022","Picked these up for my Pops who is a night owl and hard of hearing. He recently retired and moved in with me and so now he's up all night watching TV and with my sound bar/subwoofer set up he was keeping us all up! Not anymore! He sits about 15 feet from the TV and they work great. You definitely get more then you pay for with these. They may not be the top quality, but if they work good for someone with bad Tinnitus I say they are good. He's hasn't ran the battery down yet do to the fact that he puts them back on the charging base when not in use. Overall I would recommend for anyone who's looking for a pair. Also we have LARGE heads and they are comfortable to wear. Added bonus, they are easy to set up! Simply plugged in the RCA cables and power cord, and they worked once charged.",5
Super easy setup!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021","I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to set up. Took maybe 10 minutes. Didn't have any of the issues I read in the reviews. Been using it about a month with no problems so far! The one I had been using lasted about 15 years or more. Hope this one does, too!",5
Purchased 2nd Pair. Just works!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","I'm not big on leaving reviews, however, these do deserve a good review. I purchased both that have an Optical Port although just the Audio Headphone jack does work, the Optical connection gives a good Surround effect vs having just the Headphone jack.
They work great for this hard-of-hearing fella. My wife loves that she doesn't have to turn that volume up for me anymore.
Very comfortable fit.",5
Don't over charge them 😜,2021年12月10日 在美国审核,They were a 🎁 gift for my father and for some reason I see him taking them off the charging dock right after it's fully charged and he's 😁 happy that's all that matters.,5
Cuts in and out,2021年9月15日 在美国审核,"I didn't realize that the only way to connect to these headphones is with an RCA cable. Luckily, they provide an aux cable converter, so I was able to plug them into my computer. I don't use them with my TV, but I do quite a bit of audio editing. The quality is great, but the 2nd time I used them they kept cutting in and out. They also didn't seem to be charging properly - the light wouldn't turn on immediately when I put them in the charger, but would show up after a while and never for very long. Not sure I would go for these over some good quality blue tooth headphones",3
We have been buying these for a few years now and they are awesome.,2022年2月2日 在美国审核,This is the 3rd pair we have bought but we have 2 so one stays on the charger all the time.

The Best!,2022年1月28日 在美国审核,These are so amazing. They're totally comfortable with an adjustable head band. The ear pieces are very comfortable. The noise canceling is unbelievable. And the simplicity of using the headphones is very nice. They also have a very long range. I can walk anywhere in my 2 story 2000 Sq ft home and it's crystal clear sound. They also have an auto shutoff which I think is a nice feature. The battery is very long lasting.,5

Sound,2021年10月6日 在美国审核,Meet all my expectations,5
They sound much better than the TV speakers,2022年6月5日 在美国审核,"These headphones are reasonably comfortable. The earpiece cushions are firm but not too hard. The sound is much better than the TV speakers (which sound tinny and have almost no bass). The batteries hold a charge for several hours, though I haven't tested them to see exactly how long. I can walk several rooms away from the TV without losing the signal, so unless you have a huge TV (Jumbotron?) and watch it from a distance, range should be adequate. The signal between the base and the headset is not Bluetooth, and I have never noticed any lag between the video and audio. I bought this one for my mother-in-law, after I used a similar model for a couple of years (and mine is still working perfectly). This one can plug directly into her TV's optical output, while I had to use a separate converter with mine. Otherwise they seem to be identical.",4
Yay! They Work!,2022年1月24日 在美国审核,"It took a while to get these headphones figured out for our bedroom ""smart TV"". The headphones do not come with an adapter for an optical digital outlet (WTF) and I ordered two different things from Amazon before I could get them to work. Our smart TV is older so it wasn't intuitive on how to get these headphones to work.... finally it happened. It's probably not cost effective for the headphones to come with an adapter, but I wish I would have read the fine print when I ordered. Anyway, once you figure it out (and go to the settings on your TV) these headphones work great! Comfortable and the sound quality is better than we expected.",4
Did not come with charging base,2022年6月20日 在美国审核,The item didn’t come with charging base as showed so sent it back. No instructions and hard to set up,1
A fairly good value for you're money.,2021年11月6日 在美国审核,"Would have given a better review but they fit a bit tight and the ear pieces are a bit small and hard.
I once had another brand name headset that was much more comfortable and enjoyable to wear.
These do work fine though.",4
Doesn’t work,2022年7月20日 在美国审核,Got the product but wasn’t aware you needed an adapter for it which his sold with another pair of head phones an the batteries I was provided with it doesn’t work either,1
Does not work as advertised,2022年2月8日 在美国审核,"Have to plug and unplug the cable into the back of the TV every time you use them. TV sound does not work with headphones plugged in.. Was told by seller to buy additional adaptor (which won't work as I still need another cable) to keep from having to plug and unplug the headphones so TV can be used normally. Seller said they would reimburse me for the additional part but did not. If your audio output is located where you can get to it easily, these would work. My TV is mounted in a way that makes it very hard to reach. Wasted my money. Should have gone with the Bluetooth. Do not recommend this seller due to poor customer service.",1
Difficult to operate,2021年11月26日 在美国审核,"These were for an older man. He had trouble locating the TINY controls on the sides of the headset, one for off/on and the other for up/down. He always said, ""this thing does not stay on"" when actually he was pressing the ""off"" switch instead of adjusting volume. I agree with him, it was difficult to find the controls with your fingers. I had to take it off his head and hunt for them.
Sending it back.",2
"Good sound, easy set up",2022年2月17日 在美国审核,"I bought these for my husband, he stays up watching TV and his hearing isn’t what it used to be. He has the volume up and I can’t sleep if he’s watching TV. They do work well and he’s able to hear his programs. I did request for the the adapter by email as per instructions, so far I have not received it. He is able to use it with the guest room TV, but he can’t use with the living room TV without the adapter. They are not terribly sturdy but do work well as far as the sound quality and volume.",4

Frustrating to Charge,2022年2月5日 在美国审核,"I bought this for my hubby for Christmas because it is similar to the one he had! I was tried of looking at the duct tape. Unfortunately, it’s frustrating to place the headset exactly on the stand in order for it to charge. Over the past few weeks— we have spent way to much time to get it exactly right. On the positive side— sound & ease ability is perfect. I would return but I missed the deadline — my fault!",2
Not Loud Enough,2022年1月16日 在美国审核,"My husband was excited to LOVE this these. But followed directions and hooked up to his cell phone first to sync and that worked perfectly. HOWEVER, they don't get loud enough at all to be any good. He can turn the TV up to hear but can't turn these up loud enough to use instead of the tv speakers. Returning. Very disappointed.",2

"Charged Great, but..",2022年5月22日 在美国审核,"zip on pairing with the Transmitter.

After charging until the Green light on the Charger/Transmitter base went out, I adjusted the headphones, and turned it on.

The Green light on the left headphone, flashed indicating that it was attempting to pair up with the Transmitter.

Unfortunately, the Red light on the Transmitter never came on, so the headphones ""disconnected"". And, after 3 minutes, shut off automatically.

Returning these was pretty easy.

But, a darn shame it didn't work.

So, going to try a corded pair next time.",1

Only one no matter what your question is it’s the same video over and over. I can barely understand them and it really doesn’t give you any options on specific help.

Excellent headphone with equally excellent customer service on a warranty issue,2021年9月17日 在美国审核,"Just as others have reported here, sound quality and comfort are excellent on Artiste's ADH 300. I highly recommend this product. I did have one problem and it was very quickly resolved. After 21 months of use, the left ear cup detached from the headband. Artiste's customer service responded in less than 24 hours and said they would ship a replacement; no questions asked. The replacement arrived 3 days later. The warranty service was so excellent that I am giving the product the 5 stars it deserves in spite of the detached headband (which might have been a defect or might have resulted from rough handling). I see that there are some similar looking products on Amazon, so look for the ones with the ""A"" logo on the headphones as shown in the attached photo.",5
Wish sound quality was better but these are at least good enough,2021年9月27日 在美国审核,"I have a new neighbor who is hypersensitive to sound and she's driving me crazy. In 35 years of living in apartments I have never had a single noise complaint from a neighbor but this lady watches her own television with the volume all the way down and closed captioning on. If I'm watching anything after 6 pm that she considers loud she starts banging on her ceiling. I decided to explore using headphones as a possible option when watching certain movies at night.

I knew upfront that there would be a trade-off in sound quality because I have an expensive surround sound system. People who use their built-in TV speaker aren't going to notice nearly as much of a drop in sound quality when using headphones but I was definitely going to miss using my speakers.

Before this one, I tried another similar product and the quality was horrendous--bass overwhelmed everything else, sound effects and music were hollow and distant, and when watching an old movie where there weren't a lot of sound effects and music the fact that the sound wasn't crystal clear became very obvious.

These wireless headphones are a huge improvement over the first set I tried (those listed for $59.99 instead of this product's $79.99 so the higher price may partly account for the bump in quality). I'd like to find something with better overall sound fidelity but these are at least good enough that the experience of watching movies isn't ruined by the necessity of wearing headphones instead of using speakers.

With these headphones, everything is clear--dialogue as well as music and sound effects. That's the case with old Hitchcock films or with new movies like Suicide Squad and Malignant. I have actually watched a half dozen loud action movies with these since those are the kind of films that would definitely start the knocking and the sound with these headphones was good enough that I still enjoyed watching the movies. That's the best that I can say about the quality of the sound but for most people who are using headphones so they won't disturb a family member or neighbor these should definitely do the job.

The build quality is pretty cheap which is probably to be expected when a company is selling wireless headphones, charger, and transmitter at this price point. The headphones are plastic and don't feel nearly as sturdy as regular Bluetooth or wired headphones--these are made to be very light so you can wear them for hours without any discomfort.

The transmitter also functions as the charging station for headphone storage. It can be tricky to properly line up the charging poles on the right earcup with the ones on the base because the headphones fit into the base loosely. When you get them aligned correctly the green light goes on indicating that the headphones are charging (and disappears when the headphones are fully charged) but so far I haven't lined up the connectors properly on the first try once. You need to keep fiddling with the position of the headphones until the charging light comes on.

I've watched two or three movies a night with these and there is one feature that can be an irritation--the headphones automatically power off to extend battery life which is fine but that battery saving feature is very aggressive--if you pause a movie to go to the bathroom or make popcorn (or do either between movies) the headphones will power off. If you are scrolling through movies on Amazon Prime or Netflix or whatever to find something to watch the headphones will power off. They take 5-10 seconds to reconnect so if you turn the headphones back on and start up a paused movie you might end up missing a couple of lines of dialogue.

The battery also charges very slowly. If you use the headphones for 4 hours then it will take nearly that long before they are fully charged again but if the headphones do actually have 20 hours of battery life the slow charging probably won't be an issue for most people.

This is most definitely not a premium product. Everything is plastic with build quality that's acceptable but you wouldn't want to be rough or careless with these headphones. The quality of the sound is only ok but everything is very clear even with movies like Suicide Squad and Malignant where there is a big difference in volume between dialogue and sound effects. This likely isn't the best product of its kind but for $79.99 they're good enough and do exactly what they are supposed to.",4
Rechargeable batteries,2022年1月16日 在美国审核,I bought my first set two years ago and another set of head phones 6 months ago. When they both stopped working and wouldn’t charge I thought my transmitter was bad. I have spent the last two months trying to figure out how to buy another transmitter by itself. Then I was reading reviews last night when I realized I really overlooked the words “Rechargeable batteries”!! I had put new batteries in but when they died I put them on the transmitter and got no response. Duh!! Dead batteries can’t recharge lol. I know this may seem simple to some people but in my haste to try out these great headphones I missed that word big time. I didn’t have any rechargeable when I discovered this so I just put in new batteries and they work great!! I bought my first set of Artiste for 67$ and the new exact set on Amazon today was 149$ Wow talk about inflation. So glad I figured it out. Hope this helps some of you. This is a really good set of headphones. I’m 70 and my hearing is going.,4
Good quality but a little difficult to use :/,2021年9月13日 在美国审核,"I purchased this product to have nice audio quality when watching videos alone. I have a SmartTV at home and I didn’t realize I needed an extra optical adapter. It was uncomfortable to set it up initially because of this. I needed to purchase the extra adapter in order to connect it. After setting it up successfully though, the audio quality was good, it was a nice and soft fit, and the volume control was nice too. The only thing is that when you take it off, all the connection is lost and you’ll need to reconnect everything. Other than that, it’s a nice pair of headphones.",4

"Decent sound quality, comfortable to wear",2021年10月11日 在美国审核,"I like how easy these were to hook up using the earphone jack on the tv. They are comfortable and have decent sound. Quality-wise they feel a bit flimsy but if you are the type of person who is careful with your stuff, you’ll have no problem.

The buttons are hard to read because they are black just like the headphones. (See pictures) You have to get to know the buttons or you’ll be searching for them every time.

Comfortable to wear and very lightweight.

Overall these are good but I’ve had better ones.",4

Very Impressed,2021年9月7日 在美国审核,"Shipping/Packaging: The headphones arrived on time, packaged in the manufacturer's sales box inside a non-padded plastic envelope. Even without extra protection the box showed no signs of shipping trauma. The contents of the box are fully protected by a molded double plastic sleave holding everything securely in its place.
Manuals/User Instructions: Surprise!! There are multiple comprehensive user guides, in English and pretty much grammatically correct, included.
Quality: The ADH300 appear to be mostly plastic in construction but with a solid design look and feel. The molded shape adds relief to the headband where the earphones are placed. This allows for a comfortable fit on the head without adding pressure at the ears. The addition of a layer of foam where the headband rests on your head is a very nice touch for comfort.
Setup: Pretty simple procedure here and well explained in the documentation.
Controls: With two controls, the On/Off button and volume control, it does not get much easier.
Sound Quality: The sound quality was very good no matter what I was listening to (cable tv, Netflix, Xbox…). But I am not an audiophile and do not have the best hearing to begin with so that is very subjective.
Listening Distance: Surprisingly good! I went from the third floor (where I was watching TV) to outside in the yard to move a sprinkler without a single hiccup in reception. I have used Bluetooth devices that had issues sitting in front of the TV and couldn’t be listened to in the kitchen let along outside. This unit uses an RF (radio frequency) signal, so comparing it with Bluetooth is like comparing a Cessna with a Lear Jet.
Batteries: These use two “AAA” rechargeable batteries. So far, I have used these headphones nightly for a week without a recharge.
Conclusion: I have used expensive and inexpensive wireless headphones for years and I have no problem recommending the ADH300 Wireless Headphones.",5
"No longer do I hear ""TURN DOWN THE TV!!!!!""",2021年9月7日 在美国审核,"This wireless TV headset works!!!! I go to bed at 4 or 5 am, my wife gets up at 7am. I watch war, sci fi and action movies. In order to hear the dialog I turn up the TV volume, but when there are explosions the volume is too high and sometimes my wife comes in and gives me that ""look"" and shuts the door (if it is not already shut) as I woke her up.

The great thing is that this headset has three ways to install. (1) Through TV audio out ... which I can't use as I have an external soundbar installed. (2) Through TV RCA output jacks, I have a VCR attached for tape transfer. (3) So that left me with TV optical output as the last resort.

To do my optical connection:

1. I bought a SYNIC digital to analog converter (D&A) that includes an optical cable and is powered by USB - there are tons of D&A options, I bought SYNIC D&A based on price and good reviews. You need a USB to AC connector for power to plug the D&A into AC power. Total cost $15.

2. The headset comes with all the necessary RCA jack connectors. From the headset power stand that RCA cables are connected, connect it to the D&A converter.

3. Connect the optical cable into the D&A converter.

4. Connect the optical cable from the D&A converter to the optical input in the TV.

5. Important step if you hear no sound from the headset... my TV was set for ""audio format"" dolby digital sound. CHANGE THE AUDIO FORMAT TO PCM. On my Samsung TV you change settings by clicking on remote: Menu/Sound/Additional Settings/Audio Format PCM

5. Turn off the soundbar or hit mute so sound only comes out of the headset.

I tested the headset while watching regular TV channels. Then using the smart TV to switch to streaming services like Netflix, Youtube and Amazon Prime and everything works great!

If you use your PC browser to do internet based streaming, since it does not go through the TV except as a monitor, the headset does not pick up the signal.

Headphone is very well packaged. Great documentation written in clear English. Needs to be fully charged before using out of the box. Watched the entire movie Cliffhanger, and was comfortable ... and it beats getting on the wrong side of an argument\-)",5
